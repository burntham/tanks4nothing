Tanks 4 Nothing Game

Written using XNA in C#. Tanks for nothing is a two player where players compete to destroy the most of the level and for control over a little minion.

At the current time, the game's state is 'interesting' a last minute rush job for an assignment has had me butcher the code a bit >.< - Infact Player two is a very stupid AI at the moment (due to a small research project)

Requirements:
Visual studio
XNA

More details/improvements incoming soon.
